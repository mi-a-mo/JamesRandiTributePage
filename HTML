         <p id="list-title">The Life & Times of "The Amazing Randi"</p>
         <li>James Randi was born on August 7<sup>th</sup>, 1928, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</li>
         <li>At 17, he dropped out of high school to perform as a "conjurer" in a carnival side-show act which included mentalism and sleight-of-hand magic.</li>
         <li>In 1946, Randi rebranded himself as "The Amazing Randi", and became a professional stage magician and escapologist.</li>
         <li>In 1972, on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, Randi publicly challenged the self-proclaimed psychic, Uri Geller, and exposed some of Geller's most notable illusions, such as his spoon bending, as mere trickery.</li>
         <li>In 1976, Randi became the face of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), formerly known as the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), an organization founded by the "father of secular humanism", Paul Kurtz, and astrophysicist Carl Sagan.</li>
         <li>Randi continued to spread Skepticism and scientific literacy throughout his life.</li>
         <li>He sponsored the creation of many skeptical societies and helped manage many conferences; the largest of which was The Amazing Meeting held in Las Vegas, NV every year.</li>
         <li>After surviving cancer in his eighties, Randi went on to continue skepticism into his early nineties.</li>
         <li>The Amazing Randi died of natural age-related causes on October 20, 2020 at the age of 92, survived by his husband, his legacy, and those who love him.</li>
